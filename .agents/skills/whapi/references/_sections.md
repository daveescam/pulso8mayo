---

## 1. Core Concepts (core)

**Impact:** CRITICAL
**Description:** Foundational concepts that every integration must understand.
Includes Chat ID formats, authentication, and MCP configuration.
Errors here break every other part of the integration.

## 2. Messaging — Sending (msg)

**Impact:** CRITICAL / HIGH
**Description:** Sending messages of all types: text, media, interactive, polls.
Covers how to pick the correct tool and supply parameters correctly.
Wrong tool selection causes 400 errors or unexpected behavior.

## 3. Receiving Messages (recv)

**Impact:** CRITICAL / MEDIUM
**Description:** Receiving incoming messages and events via webhooks.

and misses real-time delivery. Webhooks are the correct approach.

## 4. Groups (groups)

Includes participant management, invite links, and group settings.
Group IDs have a specific format that differs from personal chat IDs.

## 5. Channels / Newsletters (channels)

**Description:** WhatsApp Channels (also called Newsletters in the API) —
unidirectional broadcasting to subscribers.
Channel IDs use the `@newsletter` suffix, distinct from groups and personal chats.

## 6. Communities (communities)

**Impact:** MEDIUM
**Description:** WhatsApp Communities — collections of groups under a single umbrella.
Community management requires specific tools distinct from group management.

## 7. Integration Patterns (pattern)

**Impact:** HIGH / MEDIUM
